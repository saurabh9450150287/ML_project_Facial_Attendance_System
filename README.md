In this project an attendance system is developed . It takes the students attendance by identifying there faces.
Machine Learning is being used to create model for face identification.

## Description
For face recognition **Python's CV2 library** has been used.
This model is based on **Convolutional Neural Networks** .
For GUI **Python's Tkinter library** has been used.
